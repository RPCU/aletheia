# Aletheia 📚

Technical documentation for the RPCU project - Open source cloud infrastructure based on OpenStack.

## Why Aletheia ?

**Aletheia** (ἀλήθεια) means "truth" or "unconcealment" in ancient Greek philosophy. Just as aletheia reveals what is hidden, this documentation illuminates the RPCU infrastructure.
